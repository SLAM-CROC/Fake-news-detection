# Fake-news-detection

### Project Description
Social media has provided an excellent interactive technology platform that allows the creation, sharing, and exchange of interests, ideas, or information via virtual networks very quickly. A new platform enables endless opportunities for marketing to reach new or existing customers. However, it has also opened the devil’s door for falsified information which has no proven source of information, facts, or quotes. It is really hard to detect whether the given news or information is correct or not. Here, as a part of this project, we need to detect the authenticity of given news using DL.              
The dataset contains around 7k fake news, including a title, body, and label (FAKE or REAL). The task is to train the data to predict if the given news is fake or real.

### Project Outcomes
•	Pre-process the data to remove stop words. Stop words are the most occurring words in the language. It’s necessary to filter that out first.

•	Evaluate the various algorithms which can affect best outcome

•	Train a model to predict the likelihood of REAL news.
